rhino grasshopper Csharp VSC github copilot scripts and geometries

DEDUCTIVE GEOMETRY THEOREMS : Rhino Grasshopper Python C#

TOP FIVE WAYS TO EXPLORE YOUR CREATIVITY with #rhino #grasshopper #csharp  #VSC #githubcopilot 

1. UI (rhino environment, grasshopper canvas, Csharp node, VSC, C# Parasite plugin)

2. Start with simple geometry in rhino and grasshopper (cluster, script editors ghpython and C# nodes)

3.  Have a Plan (sketch your ideas on paper)
     Research ideas (architects, designers, jewelers i.e. PJ Chen)

4.  Value Your Creativity, Exploration, and Freeplay (do not stick with your plan to rigidly, allow ideas to transform and be inspired by chaotic alternatives to your initial ideas)

5. After creating small and efficient clusters in grasshopper or the ghpython or C# nodes with the assistance of chatGPT and/or github copilot, be sure to add additional input attributes to your nodes and vector transformations to your outputs in and around the gh canvas.
